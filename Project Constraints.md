# Project Constraints

In designing **SegLungAI**, a machine learning-based solution for neonatal lung segmentation in MRI scans, several constraints must be considered to ensure the projectâ€™s feasibility and success.

**Economic** constraints significantly impact the project, as we rely on free and open-source tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and segmentation_models. Since funding for this project is limited to personal and institutional resources, we are unable to invest in premium software or hardware, which may limit the scalability of the solution. Additionally, the computational resources required for training large models on medical imaging data are substantial, necessitating the use of shared resources like university servers or cloud-based platforms with budgetary constraints.

**Professional** constraints include the necessity of adhering to professional standards in medical imaging and machine learning. The project demands specialized expertise in semantic segmentation, medical imaging processing, and neonatal care requirements. As this work involves collaboration with medical professionals, such as Dr. Jason Woods and research fellows, maintaining clear communication and accountability is essential to ensure the project aligns with professional expectations and contributes positively to academic and clinical fields.

**Ethical** considerations are paramount, as the project involves handling sensitive medical data. Ensuring that all patient data is anonymized and stored securely is crucial to avoid any breaches of confidentiality. Moreover, the model must be validated rigorously to ensure that its predictions do not lead to misdiagnoses or improper medical interventions, as this could have life-altering consequences for patients. Ethical guidelines for AI in healthcare will guide the development and deployment of this solution.

**Legal** constraints include compliance with data privacy regulations such as HIPAA in the United States. The project must ensure that all medical data used for training and evaluation is de-identified and obtained with proper permissions. Additionally, the reuse of third-party libraries and pretrained models must adhere to their respective licensing terms to avoid intellectual property issues.

**Social** constraints involve the accessibility and usability of the solution. The project aims to benefit healthcare providers and neonatal patients by improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung anomaly detection. To achieve this, the system must be user-friendly and seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, enabling adoption in both well-funded hospitals and resource-limited settings. By addressing these constraints, **SegLungAI** can maximize its positive social impact.

By navigating these economic, professional, ethical, legal, and social constraints, **SegLungAI** aims to deliver a robust, responsible, and impactful solution that advances neonatal healthcare through the power of AI.
