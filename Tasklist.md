# Task List

## Dhyey's Tasks

1. **Research and Preprocess Data**
   - Research data augmentation techniques relevant to neonatal MRI scans.
   - Preprocess the provided MRI scans, including resizing and normalization.

2. **Augment Data**
   - Implement data augmentation strategies such as rotation, zooming, and flipping to enhance the dataset.
   - Ensure the augmented data is properly labeled and stored for training.

3. **Develop and Test Model**
   - Modify Abood's code to fit the project requirements, including integrating the ResNet backbone.
   - Train the semantic segmentation model with the augmented data and document the results.

4. **Generalize Model**
   - Refine the model to ensure it can handle different file naming conventions and input formats.
   - Validate the model's performance on diverse datasets to ensure generalizability.

5. **Save Outputs**
   - Save the generated masks in multiple formats, including PNG, NIfTI, and MAT.
   - Save model training metrics such as loss and IoU plots for analysis.

6. **Create Presentations**
   - Prepare detailed presentations summarizing weekly progress for meetings with Dr. Jason Woods, Alex, and Abood.

7. **Implement Evaluation Metrics**
   - Implement and compute IoU and Dice Coefficient metrics to evaluate segmentation accuracy.
   - Create visualizations to compare model predictions with ground truth masks.

8. **Document and Automate**
   - Document all steps of the workflow for reproducibility and clarity.
   - Develop a script to automate the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to saving outputs.

9. **Test Model Robustness**
   - Test the model's performance on new datasets or unseen cases to assess robustness.
   - Investigate failure cases and refine the model to address them.

10. **Collaborate and Incorporate Feedback**
    - Incorporate feedback from Dr. Jason Woods, Alex, and Abood into the project workflow.
    - Regularly update the project documentation and repository to reflect changes.

11. **Backup and Version Control**
    - Use version control (Git) to manage code changes and track progress.
    - Ensure regular backups of code, data, and results to prevent data loss.

12. **Create Final Report**
    - Summarize the entire project, including methodology, results, and key findings, in a final report.
    - Include all visualizations, metrics, and conclusions in the report.
