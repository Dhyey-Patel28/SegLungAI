### Project Topic Area
The **SegLungAI** project aims to develop an AI-driven solution for automatic lung anomaly detection and segmentation in neonates using CT and MRI chest scans. The primary objective is to achieve high-accuracy lung segmentation through semantic segmentation techniques in Python. The project will begin by segmenting lungs from chest scans of neonates, utilizing 30 anonymized images provided by Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Over time, additional goals and features will be introduced to further enhance model performance.

### Project Abstract
**SegLungAI** leverages semantic segmentation techniques to automatically detect and segment lung regions in neonatal chest CT and MRI scans. The project uses a U-Net model with a ResNet-34 backbone to ensure high accuracy while addressing the unique challenges of neonatal imaging. With a focus on scalability, the project utilizes open-source tools and resources provided by Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Collaborating with medical professionals, SegLungAI aims to streamline diagnostic workflows and enhance precision in neonatal healthcare.

---

### Problem Statement
Manual lung segmentation from neonatal CT/MRI scans is time-consuming, often taking months to complete for each patient. Current tools lack the precision needed to eliminate manual review, requiring human oversight for correcting mislabels or missing data. This project addresses these challenges by automating the process to save time and improve accuracy.

---

### Current Solutions and Gaps
Existing neonatal lung segmentation methods often fail to fully address the complexities of neonatal scans, such as variations in quality and resolution. This results in inaccuracies that require human intervention, highlighting the need for a robust and automated solution like **SegLungAI**.

---

### Technical Background
The project utilizes Python and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, focusing on semantic segmentation techniques. Tools such as OpenCV will be used for image processing. The model will be trained on 30 anonymized neonatal chest CT/MRI scans provided by Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital.

---

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Initial image pre-processing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
2. **Model Development**: Implementing a U-Net model with a ResNet-34 backbone to achieve precise lung segmentation.
3. **Evaluation**: Iteratively improving the model using metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU).
4. **Automation**: Developing a pipeline to generalize segmentation capabilities across various neonatal imaging datasets.

---

### Goals
1. **Segment Neonatal Lungs from MRI/CT Scans**  
   - Create a robust pipeline for lung segmentation using semantic segmentation techniques.  
   - Achieve high accuracy and reduce manual corrections.  

2. **Refine and Optimize the Model**  
   - Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like IoU and DSC.  
   - Implement data augmentation and active learning for improved accuracy and generalizability.  

3. **Expand and Generalize**  
   - Incorporate additional datasets and imaging modalities, such as X-ray and ultrasound.  
   - Utilize transfer learning to enhance initial performance.  
   - Adapt the solution for broader pediatric imaging tasks beyond lung segmentation.
