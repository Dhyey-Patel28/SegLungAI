### Project Abstract
SegLungAI focuses on developing a machine learning (ML)-based solution to automatically detect and segment lung regions in neonatal chest MRI scans. The project aims to achieve high segmentation accuracy using semantic segmentation techniques, with the goal of reducing manual corrections. Over time, the project will evolve to enhance model performance and adapt to more diverse datasets.
